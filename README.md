# todo-app
This is a learning project to create a website that has the functionality of a todo list. It was created and expanded upon by following this tutorial: https://youtu.be/DqaTKBU9TZk

# Functionality
The user is able to create, edit and delete TODOs from a list. Each TODO has a title and due date associated with it.
The website stores the status of your list of TODOs locally.

# TODO:
Add a feature so that clicking the checkbox automatically calls the delete todo function.
Style the webpage.
